A Simple Opensource Post Man Alternative

## Why PacketMan?

As a developer, I've found myself increasingly frustrated with the direction some of the tools we rely on are heading, 
especially Postman. It’s undeniably a powerful tool, but over time it has become more costly and complex than I personally
need. What started as a straightforward utility has evolved into a feature-heavy platform with more and more features moving 
behind paywalls or into the cloud. That’s great for teams with deep pockets, but not so much for someone like me who just 
needs something simple and effective. I need a tool for personal projects or hobby projects where I can just test simple API's with
a nice GUI
